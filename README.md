# UFOs




## Overview
The purpose of this project is to allow users to search the entire database of UFO's by different criteria, including date, city, state, country and shape. The purpose of this project was also to build a website that looked desirable, easy to navigate for the user and dynamic.
## Results
I am going to list out instructions for using this webpage and the ways to filter below along with some images. See the image below for the different search criteria.  
1.  You can use this filter criteria to examine UFO information for specific dates, cities, or countries.  You are able to find specific information on UFO sightings by putting specific date, city, state, country and shape information into the different filters.  
2.  When filling out each filter section, you can either input a field or ou can also choose to leave an item blank.  For example, if you want to find all UFOs for a specific date for the entire state of Minnesota, you can leave the city information.
3.  There is no specific button to click when you are finished entering your information, as the table should be updated automatically.

## Summary
One drawback of this new design on the new design is that you can only choose one date at a time for searching and the search criteria is very specific. Recommendations for improving this in the future are outlined below:
1.	Enable individuals to search for UFOs on a range of dates, for example, for 3 months, or two years, etc. Allow them to put in a range to search from.
2.	Enable users to select more than one country, state, city or shape of UFOs to search on so they could see all of UFO's in the United States and compare those to another country.  
3.	Add functionality to allow user to export the results into a csv file.
4.	Add drop downs filters, and add more specific instructions for the format expected for the state and country filters.  It is not clear whether an abbreviation is expected or a full name of a state, or whether there are any limitations on use of capital and lower case letters, etc.
